## Translations
### Want to add another language? 

The multiple language support is built on `gettext` in Python.

#### How to support new language
You could either follow the more technical suggestions below, or you perhaps would like an application such as [Poedit](https://poedit.net) (available on Macos, Linux and Windows).

To create a new language source file:  
```python3 <your path to pygettext.py > -d webperf-core -o locales/webperf-core.pot default.py checks.py```
(or copy an existing one)

Copy the file to your locale, for Swedish it would be:  
```locales/sv/LC_MESSAGES/webperf-core.pot```

Rename the file extension from `.pot` to `.po`

After you have translated everything you should check it in, GitHub will take your change and generate .mo files when needed.
You now have support for a new language, please send it to the official repository using a pull request :)

#### How to find pygettext.py

Locate your pygettext.py file:  
```locate pygettext.py```

It might be as follows:  
```/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/share/doc/python3.13/examples/Tools/i18n/pygettext.py```

## Submitting Issues

### Bug Reports:
If you encounter a bug, please follow these steps to create an informative bug report:

1) **Check Existing Issues:** Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues to see if someone else has already reported the same problem.
2) **Describe the Issue:** Create a new issue with a clear description of the problem. Include the following details:
- **Summary:** A concise summary of the issue.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
- **Expected Behavior:** What you expected to happen.
- **Actual Behavior:** What actually happened (including any error messages or exceptions).
- **Environment Details:** Information about your operating system, browser, and any relevant software versions.
3) **Include** `failures.log`: If the bug is related to an error or exception, attach the `failures.log` file (if available). This log can provide valuable insights for debugging.

Remember that clear and detailed bug reports help maintainers understand and address the issue more effectively. Thank you for contributing to our project! ðŸ™Œ
