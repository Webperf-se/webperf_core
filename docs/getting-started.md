# Getting started

Nice that you are here looking how to set webperf-core up :)

There are three methods that we have test and know work when get started.

The easiest to setup are GitHub Actions for public facing websites.

If you want to test/verify private websites like acceptance test environments and more you are probably best to choose the docker or local machine method.
You can read more about every method on the links below.
