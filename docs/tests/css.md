# CSS Validation
[![Regression Test - CSS Validation Test](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/actions/workflows/regression-test-css.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/actions/workflows/regression-test-css.yml)

This test is validating all used CSS on the url specified.
We are currently using local version of [W3C CSS Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for validation:
- Inline CSS in `style`-element
- Inline CSS in `style`-attribute
- CSS referenced using `link`-element

Addition to test all of above sources (compared to only test inline styles that [W3C CSS Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) do) we are also adding support for:
- Draft CSS properties by using [MDN Web Docs - CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) as guidance.
- `100%` as valid value of `font-stretch`
- `@layer` as valid `at-rule`
- Use of `custom properties` as valid
- Draft CSS functions by using [MDN Web Docs - CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) as guidance.

## How are rating being calculated?

For every source (see above) we are calculating rating based on:
- Number of different error types
- Number of total number of errors

we are then combining the results.

Math used are:
- `rating_number_of_error_types = 5.0 - (number_of_error_types / 5.0)`
- `rating_number_of_errors = 5.0 - ((number_of_errors / 2.0) / 5.0)`

As always, minimum rating are 1.0.
