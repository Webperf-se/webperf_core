Please note that automated accessibility test generally only find 20-30% of all errors.

We are calculating rating based on:
- Number of different error types
- Number of total number of errors

we are then combining the results.

Math used are:
- `rating_number_of_error_types = 5.0 - (number_of_error_types / 5.0)`
- `rating_number_of_errors = 5.0 - ((number_of_errors / 2.0) / 5.0)`

As always, minimum rating are 1.0.
