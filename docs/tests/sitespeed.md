# Website performance with Sitespeed.io
[![Regression Test - Performance (Sitespeed.io) Test](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/actions/workflows/regression-test-sitespeed.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/actions/workflows/regression-test-sitespeed.yml)

Add small description of what this test is.

## What is being tested?

We will startup the URL specified with a normal browser for X iterations with different subtests.
You specify the number of iterations to use in your [settings.json file](../settings-json.md), 3 iterations or more are recommended to get most stable rating.
The subtests we use are:
* Desktop (Configured as: Laptop size, full network speed of the system)
* Mobile (Configured as: Mobile size, 3G Fast network speed)

For every subtest we are using following metrics are used:
* [SpeedIndex](https://docs.webpagetest.org/metrics/speedindex/)
* [TTFB (Time to First Byte)](https://web.dev/ttfb/)
* [TBT (Total Blocking Time)](https://web.dev/tbt/) [Alternative reference](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/lighthouse-total-blocking-time/#how-lighthouse-determines-your-tbt-score)
* [FCP (First Contentful Paint)](https://web.dev/fcp/)
* [LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)](https://web.dev/lcp/)
* [CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)](https://web.dev/cls/)
* FirstVisualChange
* VisualComplete85
* Load

The URL are only rated on "Desktop" and "Mobile", the others are only there to give you hints on what can improve.
We are using different values to rate the URL depending on it is for the subtest "Desktop" or "Mobile", you can read more about them below:

### Desktop rating metrics
For `SpeedIndex`, `FirstVisualChange`, `VisualComplete85` and `Load` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `500ms`, after that you will get penalty for every ms you are above.
For `CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `0.1ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `0.25ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `500ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `1000ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `FCP (First Contentful Paint)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `1800ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `3000ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `TBT (Total Blocking Time)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `200ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `600ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `TTFB (Time to First Byte)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `250ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `450ms`, else you will get 1.0.

### Mobile rating metrics
For `SpeedIndex`, `FirstVisualChange`, `VisualComplete85` and `Load` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `1500ms`, after that you will get penalty for every ms you are above.
For `CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `0.1ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `0.25ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `1500ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `2500ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `FCP (First Contentful Paint)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `1800ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `3000ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `TBT (Total Blocking Time)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `200ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `600ms`, else you will get 1.0.
For `TTFB (Time to First Byte)` you will get 5.0 points if you are at or below `800ms`, 3.0 points if you are at or below `1800ms`, else you will get 1.0.
