# Tracking & Integrity
[![Regression Test - Tracking & Integrity](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/actions/workflows/regression-test-tracking.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/actions/workflows/regression-test-tracking.yml)

This test is aiming to improve user pricacy and integrity.


## What is being tested?

### Cookies

In this section we determin if the use of cookies are done a secure and none tracking manner.
We are doing this by:
* Check if and how many cookies that is persistant more then 1 year without revisit
* Check if and how many cookies that is persistant more then 9 months without revisit
* Check if and how many cookies that is persistant more then 6 months without revisit
* Check if and how many cookies that is persistant more then 3 months without revisit
* Check if and how many cookies that are not requiring a secure context (this make it possible to leak information)
* Check if and how many thirdpart cookies that are being set just by visiting url
* Check if and how many analytic cookie(s) are used without consent

All of above is considered bad behaivor and will result in a lower rating.

Currently this is done by guessing the origin country of every request IP.

* Known javascript variablenames and filenames.

A url are allowed to use 2 tracking requests/references without impacting rating.
For all found trackers above that the rating will get lower and lower.
Please note that this section is relative to the number of none tracking request done by the url.
