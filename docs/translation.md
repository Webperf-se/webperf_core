## General Information About Translation

All help with writing texts is greatly appreciated! ðŸ˜ƒ  

No coding knowledge is required; everything can be done directly in the browser on GitHub. ðŸ™‚  

The following files need to be updated:  
- [404 Test (English)](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/blob/main/locales%2Fen%2FLC_MESSAGES%2F404.po)  
- [A11y Statement Test (English)](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/blob/main/locales%2Fen%2FLC_MESSAGES%2Fa11y-statement.po)  
- [CSS Test](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/blob/main/locales%2Fen%2FLC_MESSAGES%2Fcss.po)  
- [HTML Test (English)](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/blob/main/locales%2Fen%2FLC_MESSAGES%2Fhtml.po)  
- [Javascript Test](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/blob/main/locales%2Fen%2FLC_MESSAGES%2Fjavascript.po)  
- [Lighthouse Test](https://github.com/Webperf-se/webperf_core/blob/main/locales%2Fen%2FLC_MESSAGES%2Flighthouse.po)  

In this thread, I will explain for each text how you can figure out what text should be there.

### General Notes for `.po` Files
The texts in each of the files above work as follows:  
There is a text for completed rules (resolved) and a text for rules that still need to be addressed (unresolved).  
The text between the two `"` on each line that starts with `msgstr` needs to be more understandable.  

On lines where the text in `msgstr` starts with the same text as `msgid`, it is completely untranslated.  

The first part of `msgid` before the space (in the second image circled in green) is the rule ID.  
This is useful for getting more information about what text makes sense to write.  
More on this in the text specific to each file.

### General Notes for All Tests
All tests have language support.  
We start with English, but later they also need to be translated into Swedish.  
The difference between the English and Swedish files is that they are in different directories:  
`en` for English and `sv` for Swedish.

## Test-Specific Notes About Translation

### CSS Test
For the CSS Test, you can find out more about the rule by visiting the Stylelint website at the following address:  
`https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/{rule-id}`  

Replace `{rule-id}` with the rule ID you want to get more information about.

For example:  
For `unit-no-unknown`, the address is:  
[https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/unit-no-unknown](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/unit-no-unknown).

### Javascript Test
For the Javascript Test, the address is:  
`https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/{rule-id}`

### HTML Test
For the HTML Test, the address is:  
[https://html-validate.org/rules/{rule-id}.html](https://html-validate.org/rules/{rule-id}.html)
